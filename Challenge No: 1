1.Question:

You have been tasked with creating a backend system for a user registration portal using React. The system should allow users to register by providing their name, email address, and password. Implement the backend functionality for this user registration process.

Requirements:

	1.	Create a React component called RegistrationForm that includes input fields for name, email, and password.
	2.	Implement form validation to ensure that all fields are filled out before allowing the user to submit the form.
	3.	Upon successful form submission, send an HTTP POST request to the backend API endpoint /api/register with the user’s registration data (name, email, password).
	4.	Handle the API response in the React component and display an appropriate message to the user, such as “Registration successful” or “Registration failed. Please try again.”

Additional Instructions:

	•	You can use any popular HTTP library for making API requests (e.g., Axios, Fetch).
	•	Feel free to use any form validation library or implement your own validation logic.
	•	Ensure the form is responsive and displays suitable error messages if validation fails.

Your task is to implement the backend functionality of the user registration process using React. Provide your code solution along with a brief explanation of the approach you took.

Note: This question focuses on the frontend (React) part, assuming that the backend API is already implemented.
